% function bounds=boundy(x,D,minmax);
% calculates the 1x2 vector with lower and upper bound
% respectively,
% given the 1xn vector with the current path,
% the NxN distance matrix D and the Nx2 matrix
% minmax, where minmax(i,1) is the minimum distance
% from city i and minmax(i,2) is the maximum distance
% from city i.
